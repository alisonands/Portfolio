This repository focuses on utilizing Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis comprises several key components:

1. **District-wide Summary Metrics:** Includes total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
2. **Summary Metrics for Each Individual School:** Provides details such as school name, type, total students, total budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and percentages of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
3. **Identification of Top and Bottom Performing Schools:** Based on overall passing percentage.
4. **Analysis of Student Performance by Grade Level:** Examines math and reading subjects for each school.
5. **Examination of School Budget Allocation:** Considers its correlation with student performance.
6. **Comparison of Student Performance Based on School Type:** Compares Charter vs. District schools.

## Conclusions/Comparisons

1. **School Performance by Type and Size:**
   - Top performing schools are predominantly Charter schools with smaller to medium-sized student populations.
   - Bottom performing schools are primarily District schools with larger student populations, suggesting smaller class sizes and individualized attention may contribute to better academic outcomes.

2. **Budget Allocation and Student Performance:**
   - Interestingly, the budget per student in bottom performing schools is higher compared to top performing schools.
   - This implies that simply increasing the budget may not directly improve student performance; instead, the quality of education delivery and resources utilization might play a more significant role.

This summary and analysis provide insights into school performance factors, aiding strategic decision-making regarding resource allocation and educational priorities.

### Processes Done in the Assignment

- **Data Analysis:**
  - Utilized Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to perform analysis on school and standardized test data.
  - Calculated various metrics including average scores, passing percentages, and overall performance.
  - Generated summary tables and DataFrames to present key findings.
  - Analyzed trends in school performance based on different factors such as school type, size, and budget.

- **Visualization:**
  - Presented the analysis results through tables and charts for better understanding.
  - Used Matplotlib or other relevant libraries to create visual representations of the data where necessary.
