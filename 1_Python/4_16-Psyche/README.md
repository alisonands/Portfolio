## Asteroid 16 Psyche Light Curve Analysis
- We studied the light curve of asteroid 16 Psyche, revealing a rotation period of about 4.07 hours. Employing the iTelescope network and IRIS software, our analysis demonstrated a robust methodology, providing accurate results despite potential external influences. This contributes valuable insights into 16 Psyche's rotational dynamics, aligning with NASA's reported rotation period. The entire writeup can be found [here](1_16_psyche/315_final_report.pdf).
