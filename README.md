# Portfolio
This repository contains all the projects that I have done in data analysis. I am proficient in Python, SQL and Excel and have a strong background in analytical and stastical techniques. This portfolio showcases the projects that I have created and worked on throughout my studies in physics, astronomy, and data analytics, as well as financial applications in the stock market through my internships.

### [Data Analytics](Data-Analytics)
This repository contains a series of assignments completed as part of a Data Analytics program. These assignments demonstrate proficiency in various data analysis techniques, visualization tools, and programming languages commonly used in the field of data analytics.
#### Main tools:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy)
- JavaScript (D3.js, Leaflet.js, Plotly)
- HTML/CSS
- Flask
- Plotly
1. [**Pandas Data Analysis**](Data-Analytics/1-data-analysis-pandas): Utilized Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
2. [**Matplotlib Visualization**](Data-Analytics/2-pymaceuticals-matplotlib): Created visualizations using Matplotlib to explore and analyze data from different sources.
3. [**BeautifulSoup Web Scraping and Data Analysis**](Data-Analytics/5-scraping-mars-data): Conducted web scraping to gather data and performed analysis using BeautifulSoup and Pandas.
4. [**Database Management**](Data-Analytics/4-climate-analysis-SQLAlchemy): Designed database schemas and performed data engineering tasks using SQL and SQLAlchemy.
5. [**Dashboard Development**](Data-Analytics/6-belly-button-dataset-dashboard): Built interactive dashboards to explore and visualize data using Flask and Plotly.
