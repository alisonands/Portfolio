## Summary 
The report focuses on the requirements to achieve funding goals for a board game company through a Kickstarter campaign. It analyzes data from previous campaigns to identify patterns for success, emphasizing the importance of setting a reasonable goal and duration. The analysis reveals that campaigns with lower goals tend to be more successful.

Top categories and sub-categories, as well as those with the highest funds raised, are identified. The report examines three board game sub-categories, determining GloomHaven as the most successful game. The top three countries with successful campaigns based on pledged amounts are the US, GB, and CA.

The recommended campaign duration is 20-40 days, with a histogram indicating a spike around the 30-day mark for successful campaigns. The report notes a higher success rate for board games due to a substantial number of backers in this category.

The average goal for successful outcomes across all categories is approximately $9,743, with board games averaging $10,013. While suggesting a goal reduction to $10,000 for increased success, the report acknowledges that reaching $15,000 is reasonable, given the likely high number of backers in the board games category. It recommends running the campaign for about 30 days. Overall, the report provides insights and recommendations for a successful Kickstarter campaign for the board game company.
